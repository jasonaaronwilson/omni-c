# Package Management

The Omni C front-end is able to automatically download and update
dependencies.

By default packages are placed in ~/omni-c-packages/ (FIXME).

There is a package registry at http://fixme.com though it is possible
to use a different regisitry or no registry at all and to directly use
git hub repositories or simple URLs to specify packages. See the
[use](forms/use.md) command.
