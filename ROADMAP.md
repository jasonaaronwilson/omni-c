# Roadmap

This roadmap doesn't match perfectly with README.md because that may more aspirational
than what can be delivered to get 90% of the way there.

# Step 1 (basic source file convenience)

1. implement tree-sitter "cat"
2. implement header file creator (parse top-level stuff and just output .h)
3. add some auto-generated code like enum to string and back
4. eventually output a single .c and .h for all files in a library

# Step 2 (non generic features)

1. compute types of everything
2. overloaded functions
3. polyfill auto if necessary
4. method syntax
5. [] in expressions are syntactic sugure for index_get_operation/index_set_operation
6. binary objects in the library
7. namespaces
8. closures
