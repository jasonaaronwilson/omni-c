# TODO

1) make it feel like these directories weren't a cosmic collision.

   maybe split files with a main routine from "top-level" tests.

   some top-level tests are small enough that we could test their
   output cson parse tree.

2) ideally tests runners, etc., are written in omni-c instead of using
   lua and bash shell scripts. We can abstract things enough to make
   it readable and dense). 

   (Maybe output ninja scripts and let it handle stuff?)
