# This is how we eventually want README.md to look.

This file was written by hand instead of using c-javadoc-extractor. It
represents what README.md may *eventually* look. This is useful so I
can see what it will look like on github.

# Source Documentation Index

* [allocate.md](allocate.md) -- `Hook into malloc and free to make them more convenient and possibly safer.`
* [boolean.md](boolean.md) -- `Make sure that at least true/false from <stdbool.h> are available...`
