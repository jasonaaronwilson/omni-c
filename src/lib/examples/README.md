# Armyknife Library Examples

Here are a few trivial programs that demonstrate how to use the
armyknife library outside of the testing environment. 

If you want to start with one of these examples and develop your own
program then you should change the include:

```
#include "../c-armyknife-lib.h"
```

to

```
#include <c-armyknife-lib.h>
```

I am not using a test framework here but we do execute the commands to
make sure their are know obvious errors.
