/**
 * An input stream is simply a callable_t that takes no arguments and
 * on each call returns another element from the stream or
 * END_OF_STREAM if the end of the stream is reached.
 *
 * With this simple convention, we can easily transform the istream,
 * for example dropping the first N items in the stream.
