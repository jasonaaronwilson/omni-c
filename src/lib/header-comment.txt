 * including instructions for turning off some included functionality
 * to save space.
 *
 * To actually use this library, one ".c" file in your project must
 * include this file, (typically called
 * c-armyknife-lib-<<version-string>>.h) after *first* defining
 * C_ARMYKNIFE_LIB_IMPL otherwise it only provides the prototypes,
 * inlined functions, macros, and type definitions, like you would
 * normally see in a C header file and your program will not link
 * correctly.
